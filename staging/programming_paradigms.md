# Programming paradigms

At the highest level, paradigms are generally split into two families: **imperative** and **declarative**.

## Imperative

It focuses on **how** to achieve a result by detailing exact steps and changing the program state over time.

### Programming (imperative)

#### Procedural

It treats a program as a linear sequence of instructions or "procedures" (functions) that manipulate data. The logic and data are kept separate; data is often held in variables that the functions read and modify.

### Object oriented (OOP)

Instead of separating data and logic. OOP combines them into units called "objects". These objects model real-world entities and contain both their attributes (data) and methods (behavior). By using principles like encapsulation and inheritance, OOP aims to make large software systems easier to organize, understand and reuse.

## Declarative

It focuses on **what** the desired result is, leaving the specify step-by-step implementation details up to the underlying language or compiler.

### Programming (declarative)

#### Functional

It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It avoids changing "state" (mutable data). This approach relies on "pure functions", where the same input always yields the same output without side effects.

#### Logic

It defines a set of facts and rules rather than instructions. The programmer states what is true about the world and the computer uses formal logic to infer the answers to queries.
