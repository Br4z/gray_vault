# Introduction

## History of video games

### Virtual reality

It is a simulated three-dimensional environment created by computer technology that users can explore and interact with through specialized hardware. The core experience relies on a VR headset (head-mounted display) that presents stereoscopic visuals to both eyes, creating depth perception and blocking out the real world. Users interact with the virtual environment through motion controllers, hand-tracking sensors, or body movements, which are translated into actions within the game.
