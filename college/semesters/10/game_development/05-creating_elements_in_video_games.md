# Creating elements in video games

## Visual elements in video games

### Lighting

In video games, it is the placement and configuration of light sources to create visual depth, establish mood, guide players, and simulate how light interacts with surfaces. It can be used for artistic purposes to create an atmosphere and emotional impact.

#### Ambient light

It is the default minimum light level affecting the entire scene uniformly, preventing areas from appearing completely black. This represents indirect light that has bounced off many surfaces, illuminating everything equally regardless of position.

#### Directional light

It casts parallel light rays from a specific direction like sunlight, affecting the entire scene with consistent intensity and angle. This type has no position, only direction, making it ideal for simulating distant light sources.

#### Point lights

It is a omnidirectional light source that emit light equally in all directions from a specific position, like light bulbs or torches. Intensity diminishes with distance from the source.

#### Spotlight

It cast a cone of light in a specific direction from a specific position, useful for flashlights, stage lights, or focused illumination.

### Materials

In a 3D game it is a collection of properties and textures that define how a surface responds to light, determining its visual appearance. Materials simulate real-world or imaginary surface characteristics through parameters that control reflection, color, texture, and shading behavior.
