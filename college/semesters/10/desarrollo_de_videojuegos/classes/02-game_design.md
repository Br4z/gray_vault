### Kuleshov effect

It is a film editing principle discovered by Soviet filmmaker Lev Kuleshov in the 1920s, demonstrating that viewers derive meaning not from individual shots, but from the sequence in which they are placed.

In video games, the Kuleshov effect is used in cutscenes and cinematic sequences where the juxtaposition of images creates narrative meaning and emotional impact.
