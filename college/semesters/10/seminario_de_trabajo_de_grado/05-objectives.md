# Objectives

This chapter translates the problem and justification into a clear set of goals. It outlines precisely what the project will accomplish. An objective is a phrase that conveys an exact goal to be achieved in the project.

## General objetive

The thesis must have only one general objective. It directly responds to the problem formulated in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/03-problem_statement|problem statement chapter]].

### Purpose

It states the project's main contribution in a single, concise sentence.

### Structure

It should answer the questions: **what** will be done, **how** it will be done, and **for what** purpose. It must begin with an infinitive verb.

## Specific objetives

The thesis must have at least three specific objectives. These are the logical, sequential steps required to achieve the **general objective**. If the specific objectives are met, the general objective will be achieved.

Each specific objective must be:

- Measurable: the outcome can be verified and evaluated.

- Realistic: achievable within the time and resources available for the project.

- Consistent: directly aligned with and contributing to the **general objective**.

- Clear: written precisely, avoiding ambiguos or subjective words.

- Structure: like the general objetive, each should begin with an infinitive verb, but one that reflects a more concrete action.

## Expected results

These are the **tangible deliverables** or products that correspond to each specific objective.
