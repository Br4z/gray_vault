# Project development and implementation

This chapter is the core of the thesis, where the plan outlined in the methodology is executed. It documents the entire process of building the solution, from the initial architecture to the final, functional product. It serves as the primary evidence of the technical work completed.

## System architecture

This section provides a high-level overview of the system's design. It should explain the main components and how they interact. The use of diagrams is highly recommended to visually communicate the structure.

## Development process

This section narrates the story of the project's construction, following the methodology defined in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/08-methodology|methodology chapter]]. It should highlight the journey from design to a working system.

- Methodology in practice.

- Challenges and solutions.

## Result and validation

This final section presents the outcomes and formally validates that the project meets its objectives. It demonstrates that the implemented system is functional and effective.

- Test results.

- Final product.

- Objective fulfillment.
