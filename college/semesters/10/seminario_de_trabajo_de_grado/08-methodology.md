# Methodology

This chapter details the systematic plan that will be followed to execute the project and achieve the defined objectives. It answers the "how" question by outlining the development process, tasks, and timeline.

## Activities to be carried out

This section breaks down the entire project into a logical sequence of phases and detailed tasks. The activities should be derived from the chosen software development methodology (e.g., Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall).

## Schedule of activities

This section presents the project timeline, visually representing when each activity will be performed. The most common and effective tool for this is a **Gantt chart**.
