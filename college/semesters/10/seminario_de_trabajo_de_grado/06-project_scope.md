# Project scope

This chapter sets the clear boundaries of the thesis. Its purpose is to define exactly what the project will deliver and, just as importantly, what it will not. This helps manage expectations and prevents "scope creep," where the project's requirements expand uncontrollably.

## Inclusions

This section details all the specific tasks, features, and deliverables that are part of the project. It should be directly tied to the objectives defined in the previous chapter.

- Functionality: list the main features the system will have.

- Technology: specify the technical stack that will be used.

## Exclusions

This is a critical part of the scope definition. Clearly stating what is out of scope is essential for managing the expectations of the advisor.
