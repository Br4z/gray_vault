# Problem justification

This chapter answers the crucial "Why?" question. After stating the problem, this section must convince the reader that the project is important, necessary, and worth pursuing. It provides the reasoning that makes the proposed work valid.

The primary goal is to **argue for the importance of solving the problem**. It presents the evidence, reasons, and motives that make the project necessary. This chapter should clearly explain the benefits and gains that will result from a successful project outcome.

The justification must be structured into three distinct areas:

- Economic: this section focuses on the **tangible benefits** for the organization in terms of resources, efficiency, and finances.

- Social.

- Academic: this section explains the project's contribution to a specific field.
