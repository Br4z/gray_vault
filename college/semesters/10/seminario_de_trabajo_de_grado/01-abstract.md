# Abstract

The abstract provides a concise, self-contained summary of the entire thesis. Its purpose is to give the reader a comprehensive overview of the work, enabling them to quickly understand the project's core contributions. The abstract should be written as a single, coherent paragraph.

An effective abstract must address the following key components, synthesizing information from the completed chapters of the thesis:

3. How it was done? (methodology): a brief description of the methodology employed to achieve the objective is required. This section should summarize the core approach, techniques, and technologies discussed in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/08-methodology|methodology chapter]].

4. What was achieved? (result): the most significant results, findings, or products developed during the project should be summarized. This highlights the primary outcomes detailed in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/09-project_development_and_implementation|project development and implementation chapter]].

5. What is the significance? (conclusion and impact): the abstract concludes by stating the main conclusions of the work and emphasizing its overall significance or contribution to the field.
