# Problem statement

This chapter is foundational as it clearly defines the issue that the thesis aims to address. It must be concise, specific, and well-supported. The goal is to articulate a situation that can be improved or solved using knowledge from the specify study field.

## Defining the study problem

A well-structured problem statement generally includes three parts to guide the render from broad context to a specific issue:

1. The context: begin by describing the general area or environment where the problem exists.

2. The gap: this is the core of the chapter. State the problem clearly and specifically. Describe the current situation ("what is") and contrast it with the desired situation ("what should be").

3. The consequences: explain the negative impact of the problem. This part demonstrates the problem's significance and creates a sense of urgency.

	- Who is affected by this problem?

	- What are the tangible consequences?

## Problem formulation

This involves condensing the problem statement into a single, precise question or a declarative statement that the project will address. It can be a statement or a question.

The formulation must be **clear**, **achievable** within the project's scope, and directly related to the gap identified. This question or statement becomes the guiding star for the entire project.
