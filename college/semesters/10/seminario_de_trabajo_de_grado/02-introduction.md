# Introduction

The introduction serves to orient the reader, providing the necessary background to understand the research problem, its significance, and the structure of the document.

A well-structured introduction should contain the following components:

1. General context and motivation: this section begins by establishing the broad area of the project. It should explain the relevance and importance of this area to capture the reader's interest.

2. The specific problem: the focus should narrow from the general context to the specific problem that the project addresses. This involves presenting the central issue or "gap" in knowledge or practice that was identified in the state of the art review. This part serves as a high-level summary of the detailed analysis presented in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/03-problem_statement|problem statement]] chapter.

3. Proposed solution and main objective: following the problem, the proposed solution or approach should be clearly and concisely stated. This section should present the project's main objective as a direct response to the identified problem. This is a narrative summary of the "Objetivo General" found in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/05-objectives|objetives chapter]].

4. Brief justification and scope: a brief argument for the importance of the project should be made, highlighting its potential benefits (economic, social, academic). This summarizes the core arguments from the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/04-problem_justification|problem justification chapter]]. Additionally, the main scope and limitations of the work should be mentioned, referencing the detailed breakdown in the [[college/semesters/10/seminario_de_trabajo_de_grado/07-project_scope|project scope chapter]].

5. Document structure: the introduction concludes by providing a roadmap for the reader. It should briefly describe the content of each subsequent chapter, guiding the reader through the logical flow of the thesis.
