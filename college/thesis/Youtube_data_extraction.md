# YouTube data extraction

Develop a comprehensive web application that automates the extraction, processing, and analysis of YouTube video and comment data to understand public opinion and sentiment around specific topics or events.

## Primary engagement metrics

- View count: the total number of times videos have been watched.

- Like count: the number of positive reactions to videos.

- Comment count: the quantity of comments left on videos.

- Like-to-view ratio: the proportion of viewers who liked the video.

- Comment-to-view ratio: the proportion of viewers who commented.

## Features

### Data acquisition

- API integration and raw data collection: implementation of YouTube Data API v3 connections to systematically collect videos and their associated comments based on search queries. Includes handling of API keys, request formatting, and response parsing.

- Parameters and search criteria handling: creation of configurable search filters including keyword/topic specification, date range constraints, view count thresholds, comment count minimums, and channel-specific filtering options. Allows for precise targeting of relevant content.

### Data processing module

- Cleaning and normalization: text preprocessing pipeline for comment data including removal of special characters, URL filtering, emoji handling, text case normalization, and language standardization to ensure analysis consistency.

- Structuring and formatting: organization of raw API responses into structured dataframes with proper typing, hierarchical relationship mapping (video -> comments -> replies), and timestamp standardization.

- Quality assurance: implementation of data validation procedures to detect missing fields, malformed entries and duplicate content.

### Descriptive analytics module

- Statistical summaries: generation of distribution statistics for video metrics (views, likes, comments), engagement ratios and comment length distributions.

- Baseline metrics.

### Insight generation module

- Sentiment analysis.

- Content classification: categorization of videos based on transcribed content, comment sentiment and metadata.

### Presentation module

- Visualization: creation of interactive charts, and dashboards to represent analytical findings in an accessible format.
