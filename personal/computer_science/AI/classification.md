# Classification

It can be classified in different ways depending on the context (**capabilities**, **behavior** or **how it learns**).

## Capability

### Narrow (ANI)

Specialized systems built for a specific task or domain.

### General

A system that can perform a wide range of tasks at human level, adapting flexibly across domains.

### Superintelligence

Beyond human intelligence (hypothetical).

## Behavior

### Generative

Models that can **produce new content** similar to the data they learned from.

### Non-generative

Models that **predict a label, value or action** rather than generating rich new content.

## Approach

## Rule-based

Explicit human-written rules.

## Learning-based ([[personal/computer_science/AI/machine_learning/definition|machine learning]])

Learns from data rather than fixed ruled.
