# Doctest

[[docstring|Docstrings]] are used not only for the description of a class or a function to provide a better understanding of the code and its use but, also used for testing purposes. This module finds patterns in the docstring that look like interactive **shell commands**. The input and expected output are included in the docstring, then the doctest module uses this docstring for testing the processed output.

## How to use `doctest`

1. Import `testmod` from `doctest` to test the function.

2. Define our test function.

3. Provide a suitable docstring containing the desired output on certain inputs.

4. Define the logic.

5. Call `testmod` with the name of the function to test and set `verbose` to `True` as arguments.

	> You can achieve a similar behavior using `-v` in the script execution.

	> If `verbose` is set to `False` (default), output will be shown in case of failure only, not in case of success.

## Limitations of `doctest`

- Limited test coverage: `doctest` relies heavily on docstrings, making it suitable mainly for testing small code snippets or simple functions. It may not cover all aspects of complex functions or classes.

- Readability issues: test cases embedded within docstrings can sometimes clutter the documentation, leading to reduced readability, especially for larger projects with numerous tests.

- Brittleness: `doctest` tests are sensitive to changes in output formatting or minor code modifications, which can cause tests to fail unnecessarily. This brittleness makes maintenance challenging, especially in evolving codebases.

## Usage example

```python
def multiple_test_cases(number):
	"""
	This function checks multiple test cases for a given number.
	Define input and expected output:
	>>> multiple_test_cases(0)
	"Zero"
	>>> multiple_test_cases(5)
	"Positive"
	>>> multiple_test_cases(-5)
	"Negative"
	>>> multiple_test_cases(100)
	"Large positive"
	>>> multiple_test_cases(-100)
	"Large negative"
	"""
	if number == 0:
		return "Zero"
	elif number > 0:
		if number > 10:
			return "large positive"
		else:
			return "positive"
	else:
		if number < -10:
			return "large negative"
		else:
			return "negative"


if __name__ == "__main__":
	import doctest
	doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
```
