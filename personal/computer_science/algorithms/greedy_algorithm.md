# Greedy Algorithm

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution **piece by piece**, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems.

However, it is important to note that not all problems are suitable for greedy algorithms. They work best when the problem exhibits the following properties:

- Greedy choice property: the optimal solution can be constructed by making the best local choice at each step.

- Optimal substructure: the optimal solution to the problem contains the optimal solutions to its subproblems.
