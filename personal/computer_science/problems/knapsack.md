# Knapsack

## Statement

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a benefit, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity, the goal is to select a subset of the items that maximizes the total benefit while ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity. Each item can either be included ($1$) or excluded ($0$) from the knapsack.

## Input

- A set of $n$ items, where for each item $i$ (with $1 \leq i \leq n$):

	- A weight $w_i$

	- A benefit $b_i$

- A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity $m$.

## Output

A binary vector $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ where:

- Each $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ indicates whether item $i$ is included in the knapsack ($1$) or not ($0$).

- The total weight of the selected items must not exceed the knapsack's capacity:

	$$
	\sum_{ i = 1 }^n { w_i x_i } \leq m
	$$

- The total benefit is maximized:

	$$
	\text{maximize} \; \sum_{ i = 1 }^n b_i \, x_i
	$$
