# Fibonacci sequence

It is a sequence in which each element is the sum of the two elements that precede it. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted $F_n$.

$$
F_n =
	\begin{cases}
		0                         & n = 0 \\
		1                         & n = 1 \\
		F_{ n - 1 } + F_{ n - 2 } & n > 1
	\end{cases}
$$
