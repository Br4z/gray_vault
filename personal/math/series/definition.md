# Definition

It is an addition of infinitely many terms, one after the other.

n modern terminology, any ordered infinite sequence $(a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots)$ of terms, whether those terms are numbers, functions, matrices, or anything else that can be added, defines a series, which is the addition of the $a_i$ one after the other.
