# Definition

A succession (or progression) is a discrete structure used to represent **lists** of numbers in a **specific order**. The notation $\{ a_n \}$ is often used to denote a sequence, where $a_n$ refers to the element of the sequence at position $n$, called the general term. The subscript $n \in \mathbb{ N }$ indicates the place it occupies in that sequence.

A numerical sequence is formalized as an application of the natural numbers on another numerical set $X$.

$$
\begin{array}{rccl}
	a: & \mathbb { N } & \longrightarrow & X \\
	   &  n            & \longmapsto     & a_{ n }
\end{array}
$$
