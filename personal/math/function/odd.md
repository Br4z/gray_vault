# Odd

An odd function is a function that satisfies the following property for all $x$ in its domain:

$$
f(-x) = -f(x)
$$

## Visual interpretation

For an even function, if you pick any point $(x,f(x))$ on the graph, the point $(-x,-f(x))$ will also be on the graph. This is a $180 \degree$ rotational symmetry about the origin.

## Properties

- Addition: if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are even functions, then their sum $f(x) + g(x)$ is also odd.

- Multiplication: if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are even functions, then their product $f(x) * g(x)$ is also odd.

- Scalar multiplication: if $f(x)$ is even and $k$ is a constant, then $k * f(x)$ is odd.
