# Operations

## Addition

For two numbers, $a + b i$, and $c + d i$ when the addition is performed, then the real parts and the imaginary parts are added separately and then simplified.

$$
(a + b i) + (c + d i) = (a + c) + (b + d) i
$$

## Subtraction

For two numbers, $a + b i$, and $c + d i$ when the subtraction is performed, then the real parts and the imaginary parts are subtracted separately and then simplified.

$$
(a + b i) - (c + d i) = (a - c) + (b - d) i
$$

## Multiplication

For two numbers, $a + b i$, and $c + d i$ when the multiplication is performed, then the basic rule of multiplication and the distributive property of multiplication is used.

$$
\begin{align}
	& (a + b i) (c + d i) \\
	& = a c + a d i + b c i + b d i^2 \\
	& = (a c - b d) + (a d + b c) i
\end{align}
$$

## Division

For two numbers, $a + b i$, and $c + d i$ when the division is performed, then the basic rule of division and finding the conjugate of the imaginary number is used.

$$
\begin{align}
	& \frac{ a + b i }{ c + d i } \frac{ c - d i }{ c - d i } \\
	& = \frac{ (a + b i) (c - d i ) }{ c^2 + d^2 } \\
	& = \frac{ (a c + b d) + (-a d + b c) i }{ c^2 + d^2 } \\
	& = \frac{ a c + b d }{ c^2 + d^2 } + \frac{ -a d + b c }{ c^2 + d^2 } i
\end{align}
$$
