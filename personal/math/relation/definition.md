# Definition

It is defined as the relationship between two sets. If we are given two sets set $A$ and set $B$ and set $A$ has a relation with set $B$ then each value of set $A$ is related to a value of set $B$ through some unique relation. Here, set $A$ is called the domain of the relation, and set $B$ is called the range of the relation.

---

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets, a binary relation defined from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$.

$$
R = \{(a,b) \; | \; a \in A, b \in B\}
$$

> Another notation is $aRb$.
