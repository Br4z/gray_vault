# Division algorithm

Let $n$ be an integer and $d$ be a positive integer. Then there exist **two unique integers $q$ and $r$**, such that $0 \leq r < d$, where:

$$
n = d q + r
$$

- $n$: dividend.

- $d$: divisor.

- $q$: quotient.

- $r$: remainder.

This statement can also be written as:

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{Z},\, d \in \mathbb{N}^+ \implies \exists ! q,r \in \mathbb{Z} : (0 \leq r < d) \; \land \; (n = d q + r)
$$
