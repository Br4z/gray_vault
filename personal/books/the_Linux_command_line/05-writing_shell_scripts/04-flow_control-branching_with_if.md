# Flow control: branching with `if`

The `if` compound has the following syntax:

```
if <commands>; then
	<commands>
[elif <commands>; then
	<commands>...]
[else
	<commands]
fi
```

## Exit status

Commands (including the scripts and shell functions we write) issue a value to the system when they terminate, called an **exit status**. This value, which is an integer in the range of $0$ to $255$, indicates the success or failure of the command's execution. By convention, a value of zero indicates success and any other value indicates failure. The shell provides a parameter that we can use to examine a command's exit status (`$?`).

Some commands use a different exit status values to provide diagnostics for errors, while many commands simply exit with a value of $1$ when they fail. Man pages often include a section entitled "Exit Status", describing what codes are used.

The shell provides two extremely simple built-in commands that do nothing except terminate with either a $0$ (`true`) or $1$ (`false`) exit status.

What `if` really does is evaluate the success or failure of commands. If a list of commands follows `if`, the last command in the list is evaluated.

## `test`

By far, the command used most frequently with `if` is `test`. `test` performs a variety of checks and comparisons. In has two equivalent forms.

```
test EXPRESSION
[ EXPRESSION ] # The most pupular
```

where *expression* is an expression that is evaluated as either true or false. `test` returns an exit status of $0$ when the expression is true and a status of $1$ when the expression is false.

It is interesting to note that both `test` and `[` are actually commands. In `bash` they are built-ins, but they also exists as programs in `/usr/bin` for use with other shells. The expression is actually just its arguments with the `[` command requiring that the `]` character be provided as its final argument.

### File expressions

|       expression        | is true if                                                                                                |

|       `-S <file>`       | *file* exists and and is a network socket.                                                                |

|       `-x <file>`       | *file* exists and is executable (has execute/search permission for the effective user).                   |

### String expressions

|                       expression                        | is true if                                   |
|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------- |
|                       `<string>`                        | *string* is not null.                        |
|                      `-n <string>`                      | the length of *string* is greater than zero. |
| `<string_1> = <string_2>`<br>`<string_1> == <string_2>` | *string_1* and *string_2* are equal.         |
|               `<string_1> != <string_2>`                | *string_1* and *string_2* are not equal.     |
|                `<string_1> > <string_2>`                | *string_1* sorts after *string_2*.           |
|                `<string_1> < <string_2>`                | *string_1* sorts before *string_2*.          |

> The `<` and `>` expression must be quoted (os escaped with a backslash) when used with `test`. If they are not, they will be interpreted by the shell as redirection operators, with potentially destructive results.

### Integer expressions

|          expression           | is true if                                           |
|:-----------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<integer_1> -eq <integer_2>` | *integer_1* is equal to *integer_2*.                 |
| `<integer_1> -ne <integer_2>` | *integer_1* is not equal to *integer_2*.             |
| `<integer_1> -le <integer_2>` | *integer_1* is less than or equal to *integer_2*.    |
| `<integer_1> -lt <integer_2>` | *integer_1* is less than to *integer_2*.             |
| `<integer_1> -ge <integer_2>` | *integer_1* is greater than or equal to *integer_2*. |
| `<integer_1> -gt <integer_2>` | *integer_1* is greater than *integer_2*.             |

## A more modern version of `test`

Modern version of `bash` include a compound command that acts as an enhanced replacement for `test`. It uses the following syntax:

```
[[ <expression ]]
```

where, like `test`, *expression* is an expression that evaluates to either a true or false result. The `[[ ]]` is similar to `test` (it supports all of its expressions), but adds an important new string expression.

```
<string> =~ <regex>
```

This returns true if *string* is matched by te extended regular expression *regex*...

Another added feature of `[[ ]]` is that the `==` supports pattern matching the same way [[personal/books/the_Linux_command_line/02-learning_the_Shell/04-manipulating_files_and_directories.md#Wildcards|pathname expansion]] does.

## `(( ))` designed for integers

It is used to perform **arithmetic truth tests**. An arithmetic truth test results in true if the result of the arithmetic evaluation is non-zero.

Since it is part of the shell syntax (this means `bash` has special parsing rules for them) rather than an ordinary command, and it deals only with integers, it is able to recognize variables by name and does not require expansion to be performed. The syntax for operators is a more natural-looking since it uses the traditional symbols (`==`, `<`, `>`, etc.).

## Combining expressions

| operation | `test` | `[[ ]]` and `(( ))` |
|:---------:|:------:|:-------------------:|
|    AND    |  `-a`  |        `&&`         |
|    OR     |  `-o`  |        \|\|         |
|    NOT    |  `!`   |         `!`         |

## Control operators: another way to branch

`bash` provides two control operator that can perform branching. `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators work like the logical operators in `[[ ]]` compound command.

```
<command_1> && <command_2>
<command_1> || <command_2>
```

With `&&`, *command_1* is always executed and *command_2* is executed if, **and only if**, *command\1* is successful. With `||`, *command_1* is always executed and *command_2* is executed if, **and only if**, *command_1* is unsuccessful.

A *command* can be a compound command (`{ }`).

> A compound command return the exit status of the last command in it.
