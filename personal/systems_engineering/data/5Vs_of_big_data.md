# 5Vs of big data

### Volume

The **amount** of data generated and stored-often extremely large (from terabytes to petabytes and beyond).

More data can improve analysis and machine learning, but it also increases storage and processing needs.

### Variety

The **different [[personal/systems_engineering/data/classification|formats]] and sources** of data.

Combining multiple data types can reveal richer insights, but integration gets harder.

### Velocity

The **speed** at which data is generated, collected, and processed.

> Some use cases need real-time or near-real-time decisions.

### Veracity

The **quality, accuracy, and reliability** of data, how much you can trust it.

> Bad data leads to bad decisions ("garbage in, garbage out").

### Value

The **usefulness** of data—turning it into measurable benefits (better decisions, efficiency, revenue, or reduced risk).
