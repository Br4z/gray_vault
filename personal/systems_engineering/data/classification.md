# Classification

It can be classified in different ways.

## Structure

How organized the data is and how easily it fits into predefined formats.

### Structured

Highly organized, stored in rows and columns with a fixed schema. it is easy to query and validate with rules.

### Semi-structured

Has some organization through tags or keys, but no rigid table schema. it is flexible but can vary a lot between records.

### Unstructured

No predefined structure. it is rich in content but harder to search, label, and analyze without specialized tools.

## Sensitivity

How harmful it would be if the data is exposed or misused, which drives access controls and handling rules.

### Public

Safe to share openly, with minimal risk if disclosed.

### Internal

Intended for inside the organization; disclosure could cause minor issues.

### Confidential

Disclosure could cause significant harm.

### Restricted

Highest risk; access should be tightly limited and strongly monitored.

## Source

Where the data comes from and how it was collected.

### Primary

Collected first-hand for a specific purpose. it can be more relevant, but it costs time and resources.

### Secondary

Collected by others and reused. it is faster to get, but you must verify quality, context, and allowed usage.
