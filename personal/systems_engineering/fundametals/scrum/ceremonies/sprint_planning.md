# Sprint planning

It is the time-boxed event at the start of the sprint where the Scrum team agrees on a **sprint goal** and the developers **forecast** what can be delivered, then plan how they will do it.

Sprint planning addresses the following topics:

1. Why is this sprint valuable?

2. What can be done this sprint?

3. How will the chosen work get done

## Input

- Prioritized [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/product_backlog|product backlog]].

- Last product [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/increment|increment]].

- Past performance (velocity).

- Team capacity.

## Output

The result is a clear plan for the sprint (the [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/sprint_backlog|**sprint backlog**]]).
