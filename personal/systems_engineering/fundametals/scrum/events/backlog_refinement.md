# Backlog refinement

It is the activity of **adding detail, estimates and prioritization** to items in the [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/product_backlog|product backlog]], with the goal of making items "ready enough" (talking about specification) for future work.

> It is not a formal Scrum event.

## Input

- Current product backlog, especially the top upcoming items.

- Items that still need more detail/clarity, estimates and prioritization.

## Output

- Top product backlog items ready for [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/sprint_planning|sprint planning]].

- Better shared understanding that supports more accurate estimation and clearer "next work".
