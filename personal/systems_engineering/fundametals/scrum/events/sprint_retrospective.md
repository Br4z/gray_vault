# Sprint retrospective

It is the event where the scrum team **inspects how the last [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/sprint|sprint]] went** (people, relationships, process, tools, [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/definition_of_done|definition of done]]) and **creates a plan for improvements** to apply in the next sprint.

## Input

Sprint goal outcome and what was delivered.

## Output

A **small actionable improvements** with clear ownership.

> Sometimes these improvements become items in the next sprint backlog to ensure they actually happen.

## Typical format

1. Gather data (what happened?).

2. Generate insights (why did it happen?).

3. Decide actions (what will change next sprint?).
