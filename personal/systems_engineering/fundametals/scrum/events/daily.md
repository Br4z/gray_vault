# Daily

It is a short, time-boxed daily event where the **developers** inspect progress toward the **sprint goal** and adapt the [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/sprint_backlog|sprint backlog]] as needed, creating an updated plan for the next 24 hours.

It helps the team detect **blockers** and adjust quickly (supporting **inspection** and **adaptation**).

## Typical format

A common structure is the "3 questions":

1. What I did?

2. What I will do?

3. Blockers.
