# Values

Scrum is built on five values that guide how the team works and makes decisions: commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.

## Commitment

The team commits to **achieving goals** and supporting each other to deliver value.

## Focus

Concentrate on the **most important** (the one that brings more value to the client) work and the sprint goal.

## Openness

Be transparent about work, progress, and problems.

## Respect

Treat each other as **capable professionals** and collaborate constructively.

## Courage

Do the right thing even when it is hard.
