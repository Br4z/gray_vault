# Pillars

Scrum is based on empiricism: making decisions based on what is observed and learned. Empiricism in scrum stands on three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Transparency

Everyone has a shared understanding of what is happening. Work and decisions are visible and understandable.

## Inspection

Regularly check progress and the product to detect problems early.

## Adaptation

If inspection shows something is off, adjust quickly to minimize risk and maximize value.

Transparency enables inspection; inspection drives adaptation. Without transparency, inspection is unreliable; without adaptation, inspection is pointless.
