# Definition

It is a **small lightweight framework** designed to help people, teams and organizations generate **value** through **adaptive solutions** for **complex problems**.

Scrum provides a **small set of components** (roles/accountabilities, events and artifacts) that structure, but it is intentionally not a step-by-step recipe for every situation.

## Why does Scrum exist?

Scrum supports **iterative and incremental delivery** so teams can **get feedback often** and adapt as they learn. This creates more chances to **inspect results and adjust** before it is too late.
