# Scrum master

He is accountable for **establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum guide**, by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice within the team and the organization.

## Responsibilities

- Coach + facilitate.

- Remove impediments.

- Improve effectiveness.

## How the Scrum master shows up in the Scrum events

- [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/sprint_planning|Sprint planning]]: **facilitates** the event so the team can align on what will be delivered and how. He watches for issues like unclear backlog items, unrealistic capacity assumptions, or hidden dependencies

- [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/daily|Daily]]: protects the daily from turning into a long status meeting by reinforcing the goal; developers inspect progress and adjust the plan to meet the sprint goal.

- [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/sprint_review|Srint review]]: facilitates collaboration between the team and stakeholders so they can review what was done and gather feedback.

- [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/sprint_retrospective|Sprint retrospective]]: facilitates a **safe place** for constructive feedback and helps the team inspect/adapt how they work. He drives the conversation toward **action**, not just discussion (generate action).
