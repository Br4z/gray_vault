# Definition of done

It is a **shared, clear description of the quality required** for a piece of work to be considered complete. In Scrum, it is the **commitment for the [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/increment|increment]]**: an increment is only an increment when it **meets the definition of done**.

A strong DoD supports Scrum's goal of delivering a **usable increment of value** each Sprint (not "almost done" work).

## Why it matters

- Creates **transparency**: everyone shares the same meaning of "done".

- Protects **quality**: "done" includes the work needed for a usable increment, not just coding.

## Who defines it

- If the DoD is part of the **organization's standards**, every Scrum team must follow it as a **minimum**.

- If there is no organizational standard, the **Scrum team creates** a DoD appropriate for the product, and evolves it as they learn.

## Typical contents (example checklist)

- Meets agreed **acceptance criteria** for the item.

- Code is **reviewed** (peer review / PR approved).

- Automated tests pass (unit/integration), and new tests were added where needed.

- Changes are **integrated** (merged) and the product still fully works.

- No critical bugs; known issues are documented and agreed.

- Required documentation updated (user, technical, or release notes).

- Security / performance checks completed when relevant.

- Ready to release / deploy (or at least in a **usable** state).
