# Definition of ready

It is a **team agreement** that describes the **minimum conditions** a [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/product_backlog|product backlog]] item (PBI) should meet before it is selected for a sprint. Its goal is to make [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/sprint_planning|sprint planning]] smoother by ensuring items are understandable and actionable.

> The term "definition of ready" is **not** a required part of Scrum. A DoR is an optional practice some teams use to support that transparency.
