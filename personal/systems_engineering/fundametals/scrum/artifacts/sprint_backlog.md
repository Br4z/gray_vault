# Sprint backlog

It is the **plan by and for the [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/accountabilities/developers|developers]]** for how they will achieve the **sprint goal**. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work planned for the sprint, and it is updated as more is learned during the sprint.

## What it includes

1. Sprint goal (the **why**): the single objective for the sprint (this is the commitment for the sprint backlog).

2. Selected product backlog items (the **what**): items chosen during sprint planning to meet the sprint goal.

3. A plan to deliver the increment (the **how**): tasks/steps/technical work needed to turn the selected items into an [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/artifacts/increment|increment]].

## Who owns it

The **developers** create and manage the sprint backlog and the[[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/accountabilities/product owner|**product owner**]] can clarify scope and priorities, but the sprint backlog remains the developers' plan.
