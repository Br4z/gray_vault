# Product backlog

It is an **emergent and ordered list** of what is needed to improve the product and it is the **single source of work** undertaken by the Scrum team.

It contains **product backlog items (PBIs)** plus a **product goal**.

> The [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/accountabilities/product_owner|product owner]] owns it.

It helps identify the **most business-critical** work. Items get clarified and become "ready enough" through [[personal/systems_engineering/fundametals/scrum/events/backlog_refinement|backlog refinement]].
