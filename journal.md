# Journal

After postponing and postponing this idea for a long time, I finally decided to create the file and with it start writing a diary about my life. I will put (at least I hope so) the most important ideas, reflections and things that happen in my life. Of course everything will be in English (I want to improve my writing). At the first, I will try to use my own words, but after finishing the writing I will check it in a translator.

I came up with an idea (a measure against my addiction). I will create an "emergency" text, the one I will read when anxiety overtakes me, put it on my desktop, and hope that the urges are not too strong to go over it. I really want to overcome this dark part of my life, for me and for "Kate" (that ideal girl I will eventually meet). I cried writing this; I think it is a good sign; maybe I should have started this a long time ago (it feels fantastic). I have a lot of things to write about, but I think this is a good start. I should also add a comment if someone else (for some reason) starts reading this.

Today I almost fucked up; I do not know why I searched for "who masturbates loses" on YouTube. According to me, I was just curious about what I would find; that shit activated some circuit in my brain, and the urge came. When that happens, it is almost like I am someone else, someone who does not really care about the week I have been clean, and that really scares me. Somehow I managed to "fight" against the urge and win (for today). I have to improve my control over the "just do it, you will not lose because of this" thoughts (shut off my mind in order to get some dopamine). Enough writing for today, but I really need to write about Straight Edge, my feeling about this girl (Valentina) and this old "dying" feeling.

Yesterday (or rather today) I had the worst urge of my life; I was lying in bed unable to sleep, and my brain was trying to get me back to my old habits. That was very close, but I managed to resist. I am very proud of it. I think this will be a very good motivation when those thoughts come back. The book "Your Brain on Porn" is also helping me understand how porn is screwing with my brain; a lot of things make sense now.

I also set up AdGuard DNS on my computer. At first, I tried to modify my hosts file to block any porn sites (the most of them), but that ended very badly (the size of the modified file was almost half a Gigabyte), it was me at 12 o'clock in the morning figuring out how to boot the PC without the DNS service (the one that would not let me restore the hosts file).

I really need to ignore my "evil" demon whispering in my ear. Today it said: "hey, try your new DNS and look up a model on YouTube" Of course it keeps finding really suggestive content, and of course it tried to trigger old thoughts. On the positive side, this time my prefrontal cortex won. A strange habit associated with this addiction is that the name of those bitches sticks in my mind. I really would like to have that memory capacity for other things.

Fuck, I still have pending things to write about, so it will be better to let a list in the entries.

- Straight Edge.

- Valentina.

- "dying" feeling.

Eight months after my last entry. Damn, I thought I would be more consistent, I think the same happens with Geometry Dash.

Let me fill you in. Lately, I have been able to maintain streaks of up to a week. I know that is a big improvement, but still feel bad not quitting completely. Yesterday I had a relapse. It started with searching for a model Twitch channel (like many other times).

I got so desperate that I asked Gemini to do a research for me (how pathetic). I ended up in a lot of information I already know and some I did not.

"I am defenseless against my brain".

Now, that I am "here". I really have to do an entry about my loudly primitive neighbors. I know hating people is not healthy, but that fucking music is making me stupid (maybe in deep that is a fact).
