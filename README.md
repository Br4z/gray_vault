# Gray vault

Notes on everything I have learned and have not been too lazy to write down.

I really like to have control over my files, so plain text files (in this case Markdown) are perfect for me, and the best thing is that these files are universal (you can open and view them with almost anything).

I started using vscode to manage my notes, but I gave [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) a try and now it is my main tool (for notes management), the reason why I made this switch if because Obsidian is more focused for notes. I know that with extensions I can convert vscode into Obsidian, but that implies a lot of extensions and making ones myself.

All my configuration related to obsidian is in `.obsidian`.

Feel free to make pull request to fix the bullshit you find in what I have written.
